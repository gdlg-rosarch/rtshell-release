delete name server entries

.. include:: ../common/docinfo_block.txt

Synopsis
========

rtdel [options] <path>

Description
===========

Deletes an object's registration from a name server. This command will
not shut down the object itself. If another reference to the object does
not exist, it will no longer be accessible. Care must be taken when
deleting naming contexts and managers not to unlink a large section of
the tree, as you will not be able to get it back.

This command is particularly useful to remove zombie registrations. It
can mass-remove all known zombies in a single pass.

Options
=======

-z, --zombies
  Delete only zombies.

but only if it is a zombie.

::

  $ rtdel /localhost/local.host_cxt

server. Any components and managers registered below the context will
become inaccessible.

::
